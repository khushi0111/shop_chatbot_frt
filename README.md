# shop_chatbot_frt

This project is created under Future Ready Talent-Virtual Microsoft Internship.

Problem Statement: 
Now-a-days, customers are so busy that they do not find time to check availability of their needed items with updated price in the shop in this crowded world.
Usually we don't find an enquiry system or do not have any customer support of the shop and we have to go there manually to address our problem.

Suggested Solution: 
Shop chatbot is an enquiry system based chatbot which provides customer support and will address their queries like repairing issues, exchange scope, etc. It will also provide an updated list of items available with their updated price in the shop to help the customers in checking the availability of the needed items at that very day in order to save their time.

In this project, core Azure services are used, i.e., WebApps, QnA Maker & Azure Bot Services
